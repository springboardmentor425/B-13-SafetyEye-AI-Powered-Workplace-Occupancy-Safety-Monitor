# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and constructive in communication.
- Accepting feedback gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community.
- Showing empathy toward other participants.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Publishing private information without permission.
- Any conduct that is inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and may take corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Enforcement

To report violations, open a confidential security-style report through repository maintainers when possible, or open an issue requesting private contact.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1:
