Create a new file named requirements.txt in your main project folder and paste these four lines into it:

Plaintext
streamlit
ultralytics
opencv-python-headless
numpy
Important Note for Deployment:
I have used opencv-python-headless instead of opencv-python. This is crucial for deploying on GitHub/Streamlit Cloud because cloud servers do not have a GUI (Graphical User Interface), and the standard OpenCV will cause an error. This "headless" version works perfectly for cloud deployment.
